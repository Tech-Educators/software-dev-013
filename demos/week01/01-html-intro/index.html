                <p>Bumblebees are essential pollinators, known for their large, fuzzy bodies and distinctive buzzing sound. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees live in smaller colonies and can thrive in cooler climates. There are over 250 species of bumblebees worldwide, each playing a crucial role in pollinating plants and crops.</p>
